## Docker & DCT Software: An Outside Context Problem

> The usual example given to illustrate an Outside Context Problem was
> imagining you were a tribe on a largish, fertile island; you'd tamed the
> land, invented the wheel or writing or whatever, the neighbors were
> cooperative or enslaved but at any rate peaceful and you were busy raising
> temples to yourself with all the excess productive capacity you had, you were
> in a position of near-absolute power and control which your hallowed
> ancestors could hardly have dreamed of and the whole situation was just
> running along nicely like a canoe on wet grass... when suddenly this
> bristling lump of iron appears sailless and trailing steam in the bay and
> these guys carrying long funny-looking sticks come ashore and announce you've
> just been discovered, you're all subjects of the Emperor now, he's keen on
> presents called tax and these bright-eyed holy men would like a word with
> your priests.
